# Program-1  Printing elements of array

Explanatiom of code:
This program takes the number of elements as input, dynamically creates an array of that size, and stores user-provided values in it. Using a loop, it reads each element from the user and saves it in the array. After collecting all inputs, it displays the stored elements using another loop. The use of sizeof(a)/sizeof(int) ensures the array length is correctly calculated. The program demonstrates basic array input-output handling in C++.


Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare an integer variable b to store the number of elements
Step 3: Prompt the user to enter the number of elements
Step 4: Read the value of b
Step 5: Declare an integer array a of size b
Step 6: Compute the number of elements in array a using sizeof(a)/sizeof(int) and store it in o
Step 7: Repeat steps 8â€“9 for i from 0 to o - 1
Step 8: Prompt the user to input element number i+1
Step 9: Read the value into array element a[i]
Step 10: Display the message "elements are: "
Step 11: Repeat step 12 for i from 0 to o - 1
Step 12: Output the element a[i] followed by a space
Step 13: End


# Program-2 Searching an element in array

Explanatiom of code:
This program searches for a specific number in a fixed array of 10 integers. The user is prompted to enter a number to search. The program compares the input with each element of the array using a for loop. If the number is found, it prints the position and exits early using break. A flag variable y is used to track whether the number was found. If not found, a corresponding message is displayed. It demonstrates simple linear search.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare and initialize array
Step 3: Prompt and read the search element
Step 4: Set a flag to track if found
Step 5: Loop through array to compare elements
Step 6: If element matches, show position and exit loop
Step 7: After loop, check flag and show "not found" if needed
Step 8: End

# Program-3 Calculating sum and avg of the elements in Array

Explanatiom of code:
This program calculates the sum and average of user-input integers. It first asks the user for the number of elements, then stores them in an array. Using a loop, it collects all input values and calculates the sum by adding each element. Then it computes the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements. The results are printed as output. It demonstrates dynamic array usage and basic arithmetic operations using loops and I/O statements.

Algorithm:
- Start
- Accept the number of elements from the user
- Declare an array of that size
- Use a loop to input each element into the array
- Initialize a sum variable to 0
- Use a loop to add each array element to the sum
- Display the sum
- Calculate and display the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements
- End

# Program-4 To find the max and min term of Array

Explanatiom of code:
his program finds the maximum and minimum values from a set of integers entered by the user. It first asks for the number of elements and stores them in a dynamically created array. The initial max (s) and min (n) are set to the first element. The program then iterates through the array, updating s if a higher value is found and n if a lower one is found. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum values. It demonstrates conditional comparison with loops.


Algorithm:
- Start
- Accept the number of elements from the user
- Create an array with that size
- Take input values and store in the array
- Initialize max and min with the first element
- Loop through the array to find max and min
- Display the maximum and minimum values
- End
